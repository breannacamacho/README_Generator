<h3 align="center">README Generator</h3>
    <p align="center"> The README Generator is a command-line application that helps developers quickly create a professional README file for their projects. With this tool, you can generate a well-structured README by answering a series of prompts about your project's details, such as the project title, description, installation instructions, usage, contributing guidelines, tests, and license. This ensures consistency and saves time by automating the creation of comprehensive documentation for your GitHub repositories.
